The sound quality is amazing and it's easy to connect.
The battery life is longer than I expected. Great product!
The design is sleek and modern. It fits perfectly in my living room.
It is not very durable. Mine broke after a few weeks.
It is too expensive for the features it offers.
There are issues with Bluetooth connectivity. It keeps disconnecting.
Great value for money. I highly recommend it!
Customer service was unhelpful when I had a problem.
It is perfect for outdoor use. Very portable and lightweight.
The bass is not as strong as advertised.
